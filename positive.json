      "Bobi Wine, Uganda's pop star-turned-opposition leader, said on Monday he will challenge longtime President Yoweri Museveni in elections set for 2021. I will challenge President Museveni on behalf of the people,' he said in an interview with The Associated Press. But Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, said he was concerned about his safety after surviving what he believes was an attempt on his life last August when his driver was shot dead in his car following an incident in which protesters threw stones at the president's motorcade.",
      "The popular musician-turned-parliamentarian was attending a rally for Kassiano Wadri for  the Arua by-election in northen Uganda. Bobi Wine says, government forces ambushed, arrested and tortured him. On his Facebook page, Bobi later shared his ordeal. The marks on my back, ankles, elbows, legs and head are still visible.  I continued to groan in pain and the last I heard was someone hit me at the back of the head with an object — I think a gun butt or something, Bobi wrote. That was the last time I knew what was going on.Bobi's driver, Yasin Kawuma,was fatally shot dead during the violence that day. Bobi, a vocal critic of President Yoweri Museveni,  is certain security forces knew where he’d be and meticulously planned their attack. Reporting by The Wall Street Journal this summer confirms his claims and shows that Ugandan intelligence officials, with the help of employees of Chinese tech giant Huawei,  hacked into Bobi’s WhatsApp and Skype accounts to monitor the dissident and his supporters. In an interview Wednesday, Bobi told VOA he’s now adopted a sophisticated routine to throw government spies off his trail using burner phones and old-fashioned code words. What I’ve been doing to protect myself and the people that I communicate with is, one,  to use coded language when I’m talking on the phone that is known, he told VOA. I’ve been forced to devise means of changing telephone numbers and telephone headsets constantly to keep them on the wrong track, Bobi added. And sometimes,  when I have to move to a place and I don’t want to be followed by the regime, I’m forced to leave my phone behind or put my phone in a car that is going in a different region of the country while I’m going into another one. That alone is how I’m trying to maneuver to go around it. Denials Huawei, who helped build a large portion of Africa’s cellular backbone,   has also been implicated in allegations of spying on African diplomacy on behalf of the Chinese government.But Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, firmly denies spying claims and says his company refuses to give up confidential information of clients and would definitely say no to such a request, in a rare press conference at the company’s headquarters in January. In a recent interview with VOA, Zambian President Edgar Lungu also addressed the question of spying on dissidents and opposition parties in the country. There was this story that Huawei, the Chinese company, that I am spying on opposition party leaders, their phones and so on, he said, describing what he thinks is a spread of misinformation. He further explained that these claims are detrimental to the country’s image and foreign policy.I think that we need to do more … so that the truth is given to the people,  so that we are not demonized over fake news stories, he said.  They were tracking me Bobi says his first-hand experiences reveal the scope and sophistication of government-backed spying. Among the things I got to learn was that they were listening to my calls and having a copy of all that was WhatsApp chats and many other things, following my location every time, he said.1I even learned that day when I was arrested and brutalized in Arua, it was because of that technology that they got that they could listen to my phones, and they were tracking me. And they know that they follow me on my phone and they know where I am and listening to my calls. The government’s paranoia won’t stop, Bobi suggested, as long as they perceive him as a threat. And he has no plans to back down. Wadri, the candidate Wine campaigned for in 2018, won his seat in parliament. Now Bobi is gearing up for a new kind of campaigning, after announcing this summer his intention to run for president in Uganda’s 2021 polls.President Museveni has  stepped aside to let bobiwine be the next president of Uganda  Interviewed on December 2, Kyagulanyi’s spokesman, Joel Ssenyonyi, told The Observer that the engagements are still ongoing.  We are still in the kitchen cooking but time is coming soon when we shall let the country know what we have agreed on, Ssenyonyi said.  Sulaiman Kakaire, the ANT deputy spokesman, said, There have been engagements between ANT and other formations for purposes of expanding the democratic space but some of the discussions in those meetings are not for media consumption yet. We shall inform you at an appropriate time whatever is necessary.  Back at ANT, Muntu reportedly constituted a committee chaired by Wandela Ogalo, the head of the party’s elders’ league, Barbara Alimadi (diaspora), Martin Okumu (research) plus the party’s spokesman Wilberforce Sseryaazi and Kakaire to scrutinize the viability of alliances.   This was after the party was approached by other groups including politicians allied to the DP bloc, a formation of political groups that broke away from the Democratic Party (DP), plus Wasswa Biriggwa and Chapaa Karuhanga from FDC.  DP BLOC  The committee rejected the DP bloc’s idea of a special purpose vehicle which proposes a one-to-one strategy – having one opposition candidate at all elective positions taking on an NRM candidate. This strategy also encourages different opposition groups to have a common pool of human, political and financial resources.  While the idea appears impressive, the Ogalo committee preferred to study it further after some members raised concerns about the way it is structured in addition to claims that it was formed to disorganize Kyagulanyi’s People Power movement. The way it is structured is not clear; it is difficult to tell whether it was born out of DP structures or whether it has the endorsement of the relevant DP structures. We want to avoid a scenario of [The Democratic Alliance] TDA where alliances were made with parties and then groups emerged denouncing it, the source said.  TDA was a loose coalition of opposition political parties formed in the run-up to the 2016 general election but collapsed within weeks to nomination of presidential candidates after factions emerged within subscribing political parties.  For instance, UPC had one group led by Olara Otunnu in TDA while another led by Lira Municipality MP Jimmy Akena entered into an understanding with Museveni’s NRM. DP President Norbert Mao was deeply involved in the TDA affairs as Kampala Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago led a splinter group named Truth and Justice (TJ) that later allied with FDC candidate Dr Kizza Besigye after the opposition party announced its withdrawal from the alliance.  The other principals – Ken Lukyamuzi of the Conservative Party (CP) and Michael Mabikke of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) also experienced similar challenges.  We are not going to ally for the sake of it but we want to appreciate each other’s structural capabilities, a source at ANT said.  Biriggwa and Karuhanga met Muntu with a request from Besigye’s People’s Government to endorse the campaign to drag Museveni to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as well as establish a working relationship with FDC.  Muntu did not answer our calls but based on his November 21 address to ANT coordinators in Tooro sub-region, he said he is opposed to the ICC petition but would not stop any ANT member from signing it.  Interviewed, Biriggwa said, their discussion centred on the political weather in the country, but also wanted to find out whether they could work together again.  He was amiable to our suggestion but said that he needed more time to consult, which is a right thing, Biriggwa said.   When Muntu tabled the suggestion to the ANT leadership, it was flatly rejected with several ANT executives viewing it at as a hypocritical move by FDC.  In public, FDC calls us moles but privately reach out to us. If they want any form of cooperation with us, they have to first and foremost respect us. There must be mutual respect, trust and transparency, an ANT official said.  They also reasoned that there was no need for any form of persuasion since ANT has been cooperating with all opposition political forces where necessary like in the recent by-election for the Hoima Woman MP.

      "A strategy alliance ahead of the 2021 general election between Col Kizza Besigye and Robert Kyagulanyi aka Bobi Wine against President Museveni has long been plotted and torpedoed by internal suspicions and fears. But Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu and the People Power leader seem to be firmly united in opposition against the ruling NRM. Insider sources have told The Observer that Bobi Wine’s People Power movement and the Muntu-led Alliance for National Transformation (ANT) party are closer to forming a working coalition that will challenge President Museveni in the 2021 general election. The two groups have so far met face-to-face four times to plot a common strategy against President Museveni who has kept a firm grip on power since 1986. Sources close to both camps say the two principals have agreed in principle to work together but are yet to agree any modalities. Related Stories    2019-12-11 - Pass 2021 election amendment bills in good time I can’t say that we have reached an agreement yet because Gen Muntu has always insisted that each of the groups continues with its own mobilization strategy, that the agreement will come at a later stage, a source said.",
      "On Monday, November 11, Daily Monitor reported that Ms Jeanette McCarthy, the newly elected mayor of Boston City in the US, pledge to support a bid by Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, to run for president of Uganda in 2021. According to Ms McCarthy, It begins with courageous people when there is injustice that is what everyone is looking for in Uganda because  democracy in that country is not so good. I can assure Mr Wine that USA will give you support. Bobi Wine is reported to be travelling across different parts of the US, giving television interviews and looking for different opportunities to raise financial support for the presidential election in 2021.  The open declaration of support for Bobi Wine from the mayor seems to be a big morale boost in MP Kyagulanyi’s political camp.  Although this, according to Col Shaban Bantariza, the government spokesperson, is nonsense. Tell that mayor that Bobi Wine’s constituency is in Uganda. How can her comment affect the voters in Uganda who are going to choose their leader? The USA should know that we don’t need their help, the deputy executive director of the Uganda Media Centre says.The response from the government spokesperson is an obvious and expected reaction to water down the fundraising drive in the opponent’s camp.However, it is a well-known fact that politics in any and almost all substantial elections in Uganda involves large sums of money.Therefore, support from the Boston mayor and her ilk could be significant in financing Kyagulanyi’s presidential campaign. Thereby, enabling Bobi Wine to pose a strong challenge to incumbent president Yoweri Museveni.In October 2018, State minister for Finance in charge of Planning David Bahati informed Parliament’s Local Government and Public Service Committee that the 2021 general election will cost Shs700 billion. This would be an increment from Shs419.9 billion spent in the 2016 general election. Clearly, the cost of elections and politics in Uganda requires deep pockets not only for government but also for candidates. A recent study titled ‘Unregulated campaign spending and its impact on electoral participants in Uganda’ by civil society group Alliance for Campaign Finance Monitoring-Uganda indicated that in 2011 and in 2016, presidential elections were marred with spending wars between political parties and electoral candidates. The group suspects that 2021 will take campaign spending to astronomical levels. According to the study, the combined figure of campaign expenditure could easily double that of 2016 since candidates are expressing strong willingness to pay for votes.In addition, campaign agents and voters are expressing insatiable desire to take in as much gifts and cash as possible from candidates.An earlier study by the same organisation estimated that in the 2016 elections, approximately Shs2.4 trillion was spent by political parties and candidates on presidential and parliamentary election campaigns countrywide.

      "President Yoweri Museveni has said he will retire from Presidency only if his party, National Resistance Movement (NRM) or the Ugandans decides that he retires.Museveni who has been leading Uganda for three decades and is serving another term after he was re-elected in 2016 has in recent years been facing pressure from his political opposition to retire. In 2016 general elections, President Museveni won in 104 districts out of the total 122 districts in the country while FDC’s Dr. Kizza Besigye won in 18 districts. The opposition, however, claims the 33 years he has been in office are enough for him to hand over.The issue of succession has been controversial during the Interparty Organization for Dialogue (IPOD) discussions, with some of the members saying it should be top on the agenda.While responding to queries from the public on his recent social media postings, Museveni commented on responders whom he says were negative.Some of the responders were negative. Retire, they shouted at me,Museveni wrote in his response.Whenever the issue of succession has been raised, Museveni has repeatedly said that is a matter of his party, NRM, which chooses who represents the party on the ballot. In March this year, the Parliamentary Caucus of the ruling NRM party during a retreat at the National Leadershi Institute, Kyankwanzi, endorsed Museveni for Presidency in the 2021 elections. The caucus said it is at this juncture that the country needs him most. We are at the most critical and delicate juncture in the process of transformation of our country. This cannot be the  point to let go our visionary and unifier. We need Mzee now, than before,read part of the document containing the caucus  resolutions. According to the lawmakers, the president’s wisdom and guidance are still paramount as the country executes a  qualitative leap from backwardness to modernity, as well as his firm guidance in this dawn of the digital, nuclear and space age. The NRM MPs resolved to recommend to the membership of the NRM, party’s national leadership organs to support the  continuation of leadership of both the state and party up to 2021 and beyond and President Yoweri Museveni. They said the President’s guidance is needed in mentoring and growing the ideological, political and technical cadreship  for protecting the gains of our revolution as well as secure the future of the Ugandan and African people. The decision was synonymous with that of the party’s top organ, the Central Executive Committee (CEC), which resolved  that President Yoweri Museveni should be their flag bearer in the 2021 Presidential elections.CEC resolved to emphatically recommend to the members of the movement and its organsthat President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni continues leading the movement and the state in 2021 and beyond. Court in June last year, cleared the way for President Yoweri Museveni, 74, to run again for presidency, when it upheld constitutional amendments by Parliament that scrapped presidential age limits in December 2017. Previously, the law required presidential contenders to be under the age of 75 and this would have blocked Museveni, from seeking re-election in 2021. But a Bill removing the age cap was introduced in Parliament in September 2017 and signed into law three months later, sparking demonstrations and outcry from the opposition politicians.Museveni had in a previous interview said …I know there are some leaders who have been leading even beyond 75 but I think if you want very active leaders, it is good to have the one below 75. In December 2017, Museveni said that Uganda’s political opposition is incapable of offering anything to Ugandans,  describing them as ideologically immature The President took a jab at his political challengers terming them as intolerant, a characteristic he has often used against them. He accused some of the politicians in the opposition of serving the interests of foreigners. This opposition of Uganda is incapable. They are ideologically immature and some work for foreigners. They don’t have   anything to offer to the people,President Museveni told Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee at State House.  The Committee was interfacing with the President to pick his thoughts on the contentious Age Limit Bill.  He scorned opposition Members of Parliament for exhibiting hostility during the tabling of the Age Limit Bill which was   characterized by verbal exchange, commotion and resulted into a brawl in the House. The intolerance is because the opposition are ideologically bankrupt and have nothing to offer,he remarked. They are desperate because the NRM government has revamped the economy and generated revenue and we are able to deliver to the population. They now think that the only way to get rid of this government is to do away with particular players,he noted"

      "Popular singer and Ugandan presidential challenger Bobi Wine (Robert Kyagulanyi) this week spoke out in defense of LGBT rights, an issue that divides Ugandan voters. JOHANNESBURG, South Africa – Kyadondo East Member of Parliament Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine’s remarks about homosexuals has drawn mixed views from Ugandans on social media0 While appearing on South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC) on Wednesday, Bobi Wine said whereas he does not agree with homosexuals, he respects their rights. I believe that one has the responsibility of guarding the rights of all citizens of those who are like you and those that are not like you. I believe that as a leader, a high level of tolerance is required to make sure the nation comes together,       Bobi Wine said.

      "Ugandan artist Bobi Wine writes songs with blatant homophobic lyrics and calls for gay people to be attacked, or killed. The UK 2008, Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, makes a new criminal offence of ‘incitement to homophobic hatred. We strongly believe that allowing an act to perform that includes such lyrics as: 'Fire will burn the batty man. Burn all the batty man. All Ugandans get behind me and fight the batty man’ is incitement to homophobic hate and therefore in breach of the 2008 Act and should not be allowed to go ahead. Allowing such an artist to appear in public is clearly going to raise tensions and we'd respectfully request that his appearance within the UK is cancelled immediately. In Uganda LGBT rights have been taken away with the introduction of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014. The UK prides itself on tolerance and understanding but allowing someone to perform hate songs which incite violence is unacceptable.",
